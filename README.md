*Guidelines:*
 * All Pokemon names must be renamed to their national dex no. and without any zero padding to facilitate easy access.
 * Please ensure that the quality requirements for the section are met.

*Steps:*
 1. Go to [List of Pokémon by National Pokédex number](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_National_Pok%C3%A9dex_number#List_of_Pok.C3.A9mon_by_National_Pok.C3.A9dex_number)
 1. Choose any one generation you want to add:
  e.g [Gen II](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_National_Pok%C3%A9dex_number#Generation_II) 
 1. Open Every Pokemon's page.
 1. Click on its Image (on the right side).
 1. Now the most important: Click & Download the **Original file**.
  (I recommend using IDM for easier downloads, but you can download directly anyways but be sure to download the original images only.)
